# Facial-Recoginization-in-autistic-children
Autistic children find it difficult to express themselves which makes it hard for them to interact with people. Thus we designed a machine learning model that recognises emotions of autistic children. For this purpose we have used CNN i.e. convolution neural networks provided by the keras library in python.
